Simulation
------------
Contamination can be simulated by randomly selecting read sequences from two BAM (or CRAM) files at a defined ratio. The total number of reads in each bam file is adjusted when creating a subsampled BAM file which is later merged into a single 'contaminated' bam file.


Test run with 1000 genomes trio
------------
Here, a test case is provided with simulated contamination from a 1000 genomes family.
