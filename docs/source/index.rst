Welcome to TrioMix's documentation!
===================================
TrioMix is a bioinformatics tool to detect intrafamilial contamination, uniparental disomy, and chimerism by investigating inheritance patterns of SNPs. To estimate contamination it uses maximum likelihood esstimation (MLE) to accurately quantify contamination within family members of the parent-child trio. 

TrioMix can be installed by cloning the `github <https://github.com/cjyoon/triomix>`_ or using the pre-built `docker <https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/cjyoon/triomix>`_ image. 

Check out the :doc:`usage` section for further information, including how to :ref:`installation` the project.
