Uniparental disomy

Uniparental disomy
------------
Triomix can detect uniparental disomy (UPD) since Mendelian inheritance is violated. Using the VAF patterns of GroupA and GroupB SNPs, both uniparental isodisomy (UPiD) and uniparental heterodisomy (UPhD) can be detected. 
Here, we show expected patterns of GroupA and GroupB SNPs in the case of UPDs and also simple deletion cases.
